## My process
1-First i created the parent container and his child containers, which segment each part of the card, then i put its elments inside each child container, and add to each container and its elements their own classes using the BEM method, and then i applied flexbox and stylized each element according to the design provided by the designer.



### Built with

I built this project with HTML and CSS


### What I learned

I learned that i can move flex items with margin top in this case, i tried using only flexbox but i couldn't find the way to make it more precise.


### Continued development

I will implement the mobile version soon, im satisfied how it looked, its not very precise in regards of the box dimension as the real design.
